# Telco Data Analysis

1. Overview
The primary objective of this project is to analyze customer churn within a telecommunications dataset, identify key factors influencing churn, and develop predictive models to anticipate churn. Churn refers to customers leaving the company, a significant issue for businesses as retaining customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. This analysis uses various machine learning techniques to understand churn and provide actionable insights for reducing it.
